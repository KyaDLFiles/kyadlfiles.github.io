# LEVEL_4 shops
LEVEL_4 shops open up if enough Wolfuns have been exorcised.  

The save file warp glitch can be used to go back to LEVEL_4, and it's possible to clip out of the dojo and explore the level and access the shops.  

## Shops list and requirements
The numbers from [this map](/technical/disc_files/sector_pictures/NATIV/shops_map.jpg) (in particular, the open shop sector numbers) are used to identify the shops.  
**Shop 4**: 10 exorcised  
**Shop 18**: 20 exorcised  
**Shop 6**: 25 exorcised, empty  
**Shop 15**: 33 exorcised, empty  
**Shop 13**: 40 exorcised  

Amata's shop is always open, but is non-functional (cannot be interacted with and is empty)

## Items list
Empty shops are omitted

|Shop|Item|Price|Notes|

|!{^3}18|Electric bombs (5x)|10|Reappers after reentering the level (like in NATIV)|

## Notes
The following applies to both NATIV and LEVEL_4.  

When items are bought in one level, they don't disappear from the other level (also happens when items are hacked in), as the inventory and items bought in shops are kept track of separately; this also means that buying an upgrade of an item won't remove the less powerful item(s) from shops.   

Buying the silver Boomy after having bought the golden Boomy won't do anything, but buying the basic Boomy will remove the other two from the inventory.

Buying the magic board after having bought the speed board will remove the latter from the invetory.

Replaying the "Welcome to Nativ City!" cutscene will remove all bracelets except the white one from the inventory.
