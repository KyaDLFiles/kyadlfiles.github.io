# European retail copies
There are several "editions" of the European retail copies of Kya: DL, differing only in the language of the text printed on the case images and manual (the image on the disc and content is the same).  
I'm currently aware of four editions: one with Spanish, Italian and Portugese text; one with French and Dutch text; one with English text (with the back of the case claiming it also has a quick start guide in Swedish, Danish, Finnish and Norwegian); and one with German text (which, unlike the other editions, has an USK rating on the front instead of a PEGI rating, like the one found on the disc).  
I'm in possession of a Spanish-Italian-Portugese and a French-Dutch copy. Unfortunately the Spanish-Italian-Portugese copy is not in the best shape.  
If anyone is interested in contributing with scanned images of the other editions (or a Spanish-Italian-Portugese in better shape) (or even for the North American release), please contact me.  
These scans were done at 600DPI.
