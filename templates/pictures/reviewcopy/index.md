# European review copy
A few years ago I bought a review copy of Kya: DL on eBay   
The disc comes in a jewel case, with a cover, spine and inside image, but no image on the back  
Unfortunately I couldn't get the scanner glass perfectly clean so there are some imperfections on the pictures, and the disc itself has some damage/grime that won't come off, but I've done them at the highest resolution I could (1200DPI)  
I put a red notebook behind the case carton, otherwise the white edges would blend in with the white background of the scanner (there's a small white letter on the top right because I couldn't find anything completely plain)  
Unfortunately the content on the disc is nothing special, it's *exactly* the same as a retail european copy (down to the hash of the ISO)  

**Note**: the pictures of the carton and disc below are low resolution, compressed JPEGs, click on them for the full quality PNGs (110MB in total)
