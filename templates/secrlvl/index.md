All enemies except Kya and Frank have a broken/fake @!r2 + @!x move that doesn't seem to do anything apart from an animation

## Armed Grunt

## Bandaged Kronos

## Black Kronos

## Aton Kronos

## Brazul

This is how the stick position for using spell attacks works:
Imagine a circle having Brazul at the centre, with Kya on the circumference representing 0°.  
To perform a spell attack, you have to place the stick at ±45°
However, the angle is so precise you might as well rotate the stick blindly and hope you get it.

# Accessing the level

## Official method
On the main menu, enter the button combo @!r1 @!r2 @!r1 @!r1 @!r1 @!t @!l1 @!l2 @!l1 @!l1 @!du (press and release each button individually).  
When done correctly, the *New game* text will turn red
Start a new game, select a save you don't care about, or just unplug the memory card, and the level will load
Perform the button combo again to undo

The methods below were created before the above button combo was revealed.  
I'm leaving them for historical reasons, and because the cheat codes also contain a bypass for the broken maze warp.
