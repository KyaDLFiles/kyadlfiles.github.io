## Brazul

This is how the stick position for using spell attacks works:
Imagine a @@o having Brazul at the centre, with Kya on the circumference representing 0°.  
To perform a spell attack, you have to place the stick at ±45°
However, the angle is so precise you might as well rotate the stick blindly and hope you get it.

# Accessing the level

On the main menu, enter the button combo @@r1 @@r2 @@r1 @@r1 @@t @@l1 @@l2 @@l1 @@l1 @@du (press and release each button individually).  
When done correctly, the *New game* text will turn red.  
Start a new game, select a save you don't care about, or just unplug the memory card, and the level will load.  
Perform the button combo again to undo (the cheat persists after returning to the main menu).  

# Maze warp bypass

When going to the maze game, there's an unavoidable trigger that probably supposed to take you to the maze and set your mana limit to 100, but doesn't work properly.  

Cheat codes to skip it are available, among other, [here](https://github.com/KyaDLFiles/Kya_DL_cheats).

Note that while this allows to bypass the first broken warp, the warps on either side of the maze will remain broken and trying to use them will teleport you to Nativ City instead.
